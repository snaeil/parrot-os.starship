# parrot-os-starship.toml

A parrot-os inspired preset for [starship](https://starship.rs/)

## Why you should choose this preset

- It's based on the beautiful shell of the beautiful [Parrot OS](parrotsec.org)
- It's colorscheme agnostic as long as a dark colorscheme is used
- It's pleasant for the eyes, using nerd fonts

## Prerequisites

A nerd font is required to use this preset. You can download one from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) or install it using your package manager.

## Installation
